	<h2>It's me and my new Astro site!</h2>
	<p>
		I am working through Astro's introductory tutorial. This is the second page
		on my website, and it's the first one I built myself!
	</p>

	<p>
		This site will update as I complete more of the tutorial, so keep checking
		back and see how my journey is going!
	</p>

	<p>Here are a few facts about me:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>My name is {identity.firstName}.</li>
		<li>
			I live in {identity.country} and I work as a {identity.occupation}.
		</li>
		{
			identity.hobbies.length >= 2 && (
				<li>
					Two of my hobbies are: {identity.hobbies[0]} and {identity.hobbies[1]}
				</li>
			)
		}
	</ul>
	<p>My skills are:</p>
	<ul>
		{skills.map((skill) => <li class="skill">{skill}</li>)}
	</ul>

	{happy && <p>I am happy to be learning Astro!</p>}

	{finished && <p>I finished this tutorial!</p>}

	{goal && <p>My goal is to finish in {goal} days.</p>}
